### Pomodoro App — Themed Variants
*Farm timer, Oregon Trail timer, Space exploration timer (each pomodoro = travel time)*

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Feasibility | ★★★ | Simple app concept, well within your skills |
| Market | ★★ | Crowded category, but themed variants have loyal followings |
| Alignment | ★★★ | React/JS, UX design |
| Fun/Profit | ★★ | Fun to build; profit depends on execution and niche |

**Verdict:** The space exploration theme is the best of the three — "each pomodoro is travel time" is a genuinely fresh mechanic. Imagine watching your ship travel between planets as you work, arriving when you finish a session. Oregon Trail has nostalgia pull but is more crowded. Build the space one if you do this. Keep it small and polished.
